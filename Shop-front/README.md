# Cool tool - A frontend application made with Vue 3 and Vite

This project is a frontend application made with Vue 3 and Vite.
It is a simple application that represents a shop with users, products and a shopping cart.

This project is also configured with OpenTelemetry to send traces to the OpenTelemetry Collector.

## Getting Started

Be sure to start the [Docker Compose](../Infra/docker-compose.yml) environment in the main project, "Infra" directory, before running the application.

To run this project, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine (minimum version: 21).

Run the following commands to install the dependencies and start the application:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

A local server will start on port 3000, and you can access the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
