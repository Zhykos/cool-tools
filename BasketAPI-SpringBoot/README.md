# Shop: Basket API with Spring Boot - A microservice for the Cool Tools project

This is just a new version of the original Basket API made with Play Framework, see [BasketAPI](../BasketAPI/README.md).

To be honest I tried for several hours to create a proper Dockerfile but I could not... Play Framework is not well documented... The normal way works but for the whole E2E tests I need a dockerized application. This is it.
