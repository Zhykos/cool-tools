# End-to-End (E2E) tests for the Shop and all services

This project contains the end-to-end tests for the Shop and all external services like databases, message brokers, and more.
It uses Docker Compose to run the services.

All services are described in the `docker-compose.yml` file, in the Infra directory.

Tests are written in TypeScript and use the Playwright library to interact with the web application.

## Launch the tests

First, read the infrastructure README to set the IP address (check paragraph `Running the infrastructure`).

Then, initialize the project with the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
cd ./tests/resources/
docker compose up -d --build
```

In another terminal, to execute the tests, run:

```bash
npm run test
```

Then, in the first terminal, run the following command to end the infrastructure:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

> **Note**: In case you get E2E results via a zip file, you can check the tests with `npx playwright show-report`.

## Improvements

- I tried to use the `testcontainer` library to start the services in the tests, but somehow it didn't work.
