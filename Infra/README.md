# Software infrastructure for the Cool Tools project

This project contains the infrastructure for the Cool Tools project.
It uses Docker Compose to run the services.

## Software infrastructure and tools

### Services list

The infrastructure consists of the following services:

- Zipkin: distributed tracing system
- Postgres: relational database
- MongoDB: NoSQL database
- Zookeeper: distributed coordination service
- Kafka: distributed event streaming platform

- Inbucket: fake SMTP server for testing
- Kong: API gateway
- Excalidraw: whiteboard tool

### Details

Here are the details of the services.

#### Prometheus

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit.
It collects metrics from configured targets at given intervals, evaluates rule expressions, displays the results, and can trigger alerts if some condition is observed to be true.

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Requirements for the software and other tools to build and run the API
- Docker and Docker Compose

You also need your computer IP address: `ipconfig getifaddr en0` could do the trick. If you are here, you must know how to find it if the previous command does not work. You also can check https://www.wikihow.com/Check-a-Computer-IP-Address or another website.

### Running the infrastructure

Before starting the infrastructure, you must set your current IP address in these files:
- `./kong/dockerfile`
- `./kong/kong.yaml`

Replace `192.168.1.10` with your IP address in all files (see previous paragraph). It will be easy if you are using an IDE like VS Code, Zed or IntelliJ.

> If you are using a Apple Silicon CPU (M1, M2, etc.), you'll need to get Papermerge with a specific command: `docker pull --platform linux/amd64  papermerge/papermerge:xxx` (replace `xxx` with the correct version specified in the `docker-compose.yml` file). More information about the 3.4 version, for instance: https://docs.papermerge.io/3.4/setup/docker/#apple-m1-m2-users.

Start the infrastructure with the following command:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

To stop the infrastructure, use the following command:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

## Improvements

- Well... it's just an infrastructure, so it's perfect! ðŸ˜…
